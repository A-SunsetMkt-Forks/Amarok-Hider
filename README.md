## What is Amarok?


Amarok is an Android application which enables you to hide your private files & apps with a single click.

> In many cases, we use sophisticated encryptors to encrypt our files and apps, just not wanting others to see them. However, many of these encryptors are slow and resource-intensive, making the encryption of large files such as videos and music a daunting task. While these solutions may be secure, they are often overkill for the average user who simply wants to prevent others from accidentally accessing their private files and apps.

Amarok is designed to avoid using complex encryption for files and applications. Instead, it takes a "hide" approach:
- Amarok obfuscates file names and headers, making them appear "corrupted" and inaccessible.
- Amarok deactivates applications, rendering them invisible in the launcher and system menu.


## Features

- **User-Friendly**: Easily hide files and applications with a single click.
- **Fast and Efficient Hiding of Large Files**: Only file name and signature are obfuscated; file size doesn't affect the hiding speed.
- **Root-Free Application Hiding**: Hide applications from the launcher. Currently supports Root, Shizuku, Dhizuku, and DSM modes.
- **Boss Key**: Use a floating button to quickly hide applications and files in emergency situations.
- **Quick Settings**: Control center switch for instant hiding without the need to open the app.
- **App Lock**: Supports accessing Amarok with a password or fingerprint.
- **Pleasant Interface**: Clean and appealing Material3 design.  


> **Warning**  
> Please note that Amarok is not an encryption software, but rather a tool for hiding things. We strongly advise against using Amarok to protect confidential files and applications.
