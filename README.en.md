## What is Amarok?
Amarok is an Android application which enables you to hide your private files & apps with just one click.

> In many cases, we use sophisticated encryptors to encrypt our files and apps, just not wanting others to see them.  
> Most of the encryptors are slow and heavy, which makes encrypting large files like videos and music become a nightmare. Though that's indeed secure.  
> But often we don't need such kind of security at all. We simply not wanting others to see them by accident.  

And Amarok is precisely such a tool — a lightweight file "hider". It obfuscates filenames and file signatures, so the files become unreadable by humans. And it "disables" apps to hide them from the launcher. All of these can be done with just one click.

## Features
- **High-speed Large File Hiding**: Obfuscate filenames and file signatures to make files unreadable.  
- **Root-free Application Hiding**: Make apps invisible on the launcher. Currently, it supports Root, Shizuku and DSM modes.  
- **Exquisite UI**: Full Material3 design.

**<u>NOTE: AMAROK IS NOT AN ENCRYPTION TOOL. IT JUST "OBFUSCATE" FILES SO THEY CAN NOT BE READ BY HUMANS AND DISABLE APPS TO "HIDE". THESE PROCESSES CAN BE EASILY REVERTED. DO NOT USE AMAROK TO PROTECT IMPORTANT FILES! </u>**
